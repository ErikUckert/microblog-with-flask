Flaskr - A microblog powered by flask
====


## This is a little microblog demo for setting up flask

You can get more information about the microframework [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/). There one can find tutorial, documentation and guides how to install and run flask in general.

Try it on your own!
----

1. Clone the repository to a local directory

2. Install Python 3!
You can find informations on how to do that [here](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/).

3. Check if you have pip installed
    
    ```
    $ python3 -m pip3 --version
    ```

    otherwise go install it. Look up how to do that [here](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

4. Create a virtual environment. Lookup details [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or in a more simple style [here](https://realpython.com/courses/working-python-virtual-environments/).

    ```
    $ python3 -m venv myflaskrvenv
    ```

5. Activate the virtual environment 
    ```
    $ source myflaskrvenv/bin/activate
    ```
    Or look up how to do that on your particalar os. Once you are in your virtual environment you can deactivate it like so

    ```
    $ deactivate
    ```

4. Go to the flaskr main directory and install the package

    ```
    $ pip install -e .
    ```
